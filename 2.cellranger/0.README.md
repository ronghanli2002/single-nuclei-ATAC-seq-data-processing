# Use `cellranger-atac` to align sequencing files
Refer to https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/2022-July-Advanced-Topics-in-Single-Cell-RNA-Seq-ATAC/data_reduction/ATAC to learn more about how to use cellranger-atac
## Docker image
Use `cumulusprod/cellranger-atac:2.1.0` to implement `cellranger-atac`
```
bsub -Is -q general-interactive -G compute-yeli -R 'rusage[mem=32GB]' -a 'docker(cumulusprod/cellranger-atac:2.1.0)' /bin/bash
```
After pulling down the docker image, add environment variables
```
export PATH=/software:/software/cellranger-atac-2.1.0:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:$PATH
```
To find environment variables for certain command/apps in certain docker images:
- Docker pull on your own device and execute the container.
- Run this command in the root environment: `echo $PATH`

## Reference
There are prebuilt human and mouse reference packages for use with Cell Ranger ATAC, which we will be using in this workshop. For other species, or to create a custom reference, one can use cellranger-atac mkref.
